Installation from PyPI is the default way to install the raymon client library. This library can be used to integrate in your production code and send data to the Raymon backend that can be deployed and managed by you, or can be hosted by us. See :ref:`Deploying the Raymon backend`

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install raymon

Deploying the Raymon backend

The Raymon backend runs on Kubernetes or Docker swarm. See the instructions on the `git repo <https://github.com/raymon-ai/raymon-api>`_ for deploying the backend.
